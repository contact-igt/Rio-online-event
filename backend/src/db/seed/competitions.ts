// The six competitions, copied from website/lib/events.ts (the single source of truth for the public site). Only what the `events` table can
// hold is here: slug, Tamil and English name, age range, and the order the poster prints them. The task sentences have no column yet, and no dates,
// questions or consent text are seeded. A test (seed-events.test.ts) reads website/lib/events.ts and fails if this list ever drifts from it.
//
// The English names are plain-language glosses marked for owner confirmation in PROJECT_BRIEF.md; they are seeded as they stand there.
