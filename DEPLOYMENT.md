# Release checklist: Rio Children's Day 2026

Status 2026-11-06 (announcement date 14 November 2026 IST, eight days away): **the MVP is built and has passed one complete journey on the
DEV project. Nothing is deployed and no production resource exists. NOT READY for production.** This file names settings and steps; it never
contains a value. Evidence for every claim: `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` §27 to §33.

## 0. Repository layout and the two sites

Three folders, each a complete project of its own (own `package.json`, `package-lock.json` and `node_modules`; run `npm install` inside the folder you want, then its commands):

| Folder | What it is | Run | Deployed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `website/` | public site for parents: landing, competitions, registration, sign-in, account, results, upload, e-mail sweep | `npm run dev` (port 3000) | Vercel project 1, root directory `website` |
| `admin/` | admin panel, judge panel and staff sign-in (`/admin`, `/judge`, `/staff`) | `npm run dev` (port 3001) | Vercel project 2, root directory `admin`, its own (sub)domain, for example `admin.<domain>` |
| `backend/` | Node.js + Express + TypeScript API. **M1:** `GET /api/v1/health`, request ids, security headers, body limit, safe logging, graceful shutdown. **M2A:** MySQL-protocol / SQLite database layer (Kysely, mysql2, `node:sqlite`), versioned migrations with checksums, environment guards. **M2B: 18 application tables and a results view (MariaDB, MySQL and SQLite migration folders), no seed data. **M3: staff sign-in** (`/api/v1/staff/login|logout|me|password`, Argon2id, database sessions, CSRF, rate limits, `staff:create-admin` command), not yet used by the Next apps. No registration yet** | `npm run dev` (port 4000) | Railway service with root directory `backend` |
| `database/` | Supabase migrations, seed, templates, SQL tests and the guarded DEV tooling | `npm test`, `npm run db:dev:*` | not deployed; migrations are applied as in section 6 |

Backend commands (inside `backend/`; Node 24): `npm install`, then `npm run dev` (reads git-ignored `.env.local` if present, restarts on change), `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, `npm start` (runs `dist/`). Database scripts: `npm run migrate` (checks database identity and schema, then applies pending versioned migrations), `npm run db:status` (read-only history and drift report), `npm run db:drop` (disposable loopback development databases only, with a typed database-name confirmation), and `npm run db:verify` (also run by CI; checks that migration dialect folders match). Variables: see `backend/.env.example`. For Railway leave `HOST` unset (it binds `0.0.0.0` when `NODE_ENV=production`) and let Railway provide `PORT`.

Backend database rules (enforced by `backend/src/config.ts`, tested): `sqlite` is refused in production; a MySQL-protocol `DATABASE_URL` must have a host equal to `DB_ALLOWED_HOST`; under `NODE_ENV=test` the database must be local and named `*_test` (or SQLite `:memory:`/`*.test.sqlite`), and tests read only `RIO_TEST_*` variables, never `DATABASE_URL`; a `*_test` database is refused outside tests and a loopback database is refused in production. Explicit migration and staff CLI commands require `DB_ALLOWED_DATABASE` to match the configured and actual connected database; they do not need separate confirmation environment variables. Local development database name: `rio_hospital` on the XAMPP MariaDB (`DB_ENGINE=mariadb`, migrations in `backend/migrations/mariadb/`; no Docker is used or needed); automated tests never run on `rio_hospital`: they create and drop tables, so the configuration refuses any test database whose name does not end in `_test`, and there is no standing test database (see `backend/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md`). Production is hosted MariaDB (`DB_ENGINE=mariadb`) and additionally requires `DB_ACCEPT_MARIADB_IN_PRODUCTION=<approved database name>`. Full workflow: `backend/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md`.

Each of the website and the admin carries its own copy of the small amount of code both need (Supabase clients, staff and auth checks, schemas, styles).
A change to one of those files (`lib/supabase`, `lib/auth`, `lib/staff/auth|messages|paths`, `lib/registration/consent|date|settings`, `lib/events.ts`, `lib/storage`,
`components/auth/bilingual|submit-button`, `components/ui/icon`, `lib/fonts.ts`, `app/globals.css`) must be made in both folders.
The tests in `database/supabase/tests` that exercise application code read the `website` and `admin` folders next to it, and the two static guards in `admin/tests`
(`admin-boundary.test.ts`, `boundary.test.ts`) read the `website` folder next to `admin`; everything else runs inside its own folder.

Each site has its own environment variables: see `website/.env.example`, `admin/.env.example` and `database/.env.example`. The secret key and the staff switches (`RIO_STAFF_*`,
`RIO_PLAYBACK_ENABLED`) belong to the admin project only; the upload, finalize and e-mail settings belong to the website project only; both need the same Supabase project
values. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_URL` on the website to the admin site address (it only builds the "Staff login" links). Staff sessions live on the admin domain, so staff
sign in on the admin site. Where this file says "the app", read the site named by the folder above.

## 1. Completed functionality

"DEV-live" = exercised once against the real DEV Supabase project and the real DEV R2 bucket (journey, brief §32). "Offline" = automated tests only.

| Area | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Landing page, `/competitions` (age filter 3 to 12), competition details, registration, success, administrator and judge screens in the approved pink and navy design; mobile first; no poster | built (final redesign) | offline: browser checks at 360, 390, 768 and 1440 px, AA contrast measured on every text |
| Parent email-code sign-in | built | DEV-live |
| Child registration, draft saving, consent record | built; registration closed until an administrator sets a window | DEV-live |
| Private video upload (direct to R2 with a 15-minute signed URL) | built; switch `RIO_UPLOADS_ENABLED` | DEV-live (Chrome-made MP4 and WebM) |
| Participation confirmation e-mail (outbox, retry endpoint, bilingual template with competition, reference and announcement date; no link, no video) | built; **sending OFF** (`RIO_EMAIL_ENABLED`), needs migration 00800 and a configured and tested provider | offline with mocks and real Postgres; **never sent a real e-mail** |
| Final submission: ownership, consent, window, HeadObject re-check (size, type, ETag), header-level inspection, atomic locked state, duplicate-child protection | built; switch `RIO_FINALIZE_ENABLED` | DEV-live |
| Staff sign-in at `/staff/login` (email and password through Supabase Auth; the role is then checked in the database; sign-out; no registration, no reset page) | built (staff-login change) | offline: unit, database-role and browser tests; **not yet run against DEV** (no staff account exists there) |
| Administrator area: competitions, entries by status, judge assignment, judges' progress, ranking, winner confirmation | built | DEV-live |
| Judge area: only assigned entries, no child or parent data, private playback (5-minute link, audited), draft and final score | built; switch `RIO_PLAYBACK_ENABLED` | DEV-live |
| Ranking: average of final marks, only complete entries, ties flagged and never resolved | built | offline, DEV-live (no tie) |
| Public winners page `/results`: shows nothing until publication is scheduled **and** its time has passed; never cached; never publishes | built (M7) | offline; the built server answered "to be announced" on DEV |
| Audit log of role, assignment, score, winner, status changes and every playback link | built | DEV-live |
| Publication of results (scheduling the time) | **no screen**: done by SQL (section 6, step 10) | n/a |
| Staff accounts | **no screen**: provisioned explicitly (section 6, step 5); there is no public staff registration | n/a |

Last test results: 606 unit and database tests on Postgres 17 and 18, 131 browser tests, build (before M7); M7 additions: results unit 9, results database 7,
static guards, results browser 6 (contrast and 360 px measured), 30 browser tests re-run after the footer change, one production build. The journey and
fixture suites were not repeated.

## 2. Environment variables

### The three-app wiring (Express API + MariaDB): the settings every deployment needs

None of these has a default in any environment. A missing or unusable value is an error that names the variable (server log; the sign-in page says "not set up on this site"). None is a secret, and none is `NEXT_PUBLIC_` except the website's link to the admin site.

**One `.env` per app, no other env file.** `admin/.env` and `website/.env` hold both environments side by side; the code picks the pair by mode, so nothing is switched by hand: `npm run dev` reads the `_DEVELOPMENT` names, a production build (`npm run build`, `npm start`, Vercel) reads the `_PRODUCTION` names. A plain name without a suffix, when set (a Vercel setting, a test), wins.

| Application | Variable (suffix `_DEVELOPMENT` / `_PRODUCTION`) | Development value | Production value | Where it is read from |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Website | `RIO_BACKEND_API_URL` | `http://localhost:4000` | `https://rio-online-event-production.up.railway.app` | `website/.env` locally; Vercel (website project) |
| Website | `RIO_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` (this site; must be in the API's `PUBLIC_ORIGINS`) | `http://localhost:3000` | `https://rio-online-event-gia5.vercel.app` | `website/.env` locally; Vercel |
| Website | `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_URL` (links to the admin site) | `http://localhost:3001` | `https://rio-online-event-vuw2.vercel.app` | `website/.env` locally; Vercel |
| Admin | `RIO_BACKEND_API_URL` | `http://localhost:4000` | `https://rio-online-event-production.up.railway.app` | `admin/.env` locally; Vercel (admin project) |
| Admin | `RIO_ADMIN_ORIGIN` (this site; must be in the API's `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`) | `http://localhost:3001` | `https://rio-online-event-vuw2.vercel.app` | `admin/.env` locally; Vercel |
| Backend | `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` / `PUBLIC_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:3001` / `http://localhost:3000` | `https://rio-online-event-vuw2.vercel.app` / `https://rio-online-event-gia5.vercel.app` | `backend/.env.development.local` locally (read by `npm run dev` and the `*:dev` commands, never `backend/.env`); Railway variables |
| Backend | `NODE_ENV` `APP_ENV` `DB_*` `DATABASE_URL` `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` | SQLite or XAMPP MariaDB (see `backend/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md`) | see "Backend database variables" below; `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS=1` behind Railway | Railway variables only (`npm start` reads no file) |

Rules the code enforces (tests in `*/lib/api/origin.test.ts`, `*/tests/no-supabase-runtime.test.ts`, `backend/src/package-scripts.test.ts`):
- Under `next dev` a hosted API address is refused, so Production can never be reached from a developer machine by a stray value. A local `next build` + `next start` is a production-mode run and reads the `_PRODUCTION` lines (the real API): use it deliberately.
- On Vercel an address that points at the machine itself (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`) is refused, and plain `http://` to a hosted address is refused in production. A trailing `/api/v1` on the API address is removed.
- The old name `RIO_API_ORIGIN` is no longer read.
- **Vercel does not see the git-ignored `.env`.** Before this code is deployed set, in each Vercel project (Production scope), the same names with the `_PRODUCTION` suffix (or the plain names): the API address on both, `RIO_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_URL` on the website, `RIO_ADMIN_ORIGIN` on the admin site. `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_URL` is read at build time, so redeploy after setting it. Without the origin settings, sign-in and registration changes stop with a clear error instead of presenting `localhost` to the API.

Set in Vercel **Production** scope only. Nothing here exists in any production environment yet (all are "missing"). Values are never written in this repo.

| Name | Secret | Needed at build | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | no | **yes** (inlined into the build) | the PRODUCTION project |
| `RIO_SUPABASE_ALLOWED_REF` | no | no | the production project ref; the app refuses any other project |
| `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` | **yes** | no | service-role key; server code only (upload, finalization, playback) |
| `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` | no | **yes** (the Content-Security-Policy is built from it) | production account |
| `R2_BUCKET_NAME`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | **yes** (key, secret) | no | the PRODUCTION bucket and a token scoped to it |
| `RIO_OTP_LENGTH` | no | no | equal to the OTP length set in Supabase Auth (6 to 10; default 6) |
| `RIO_UPLOADS_ENABLED`, `RIO_FINALIZE_ENABLED`, `RIO_PLAYBACK_ENABLED` | no | **yes** (the policy names the bucket host only when uploads or playback are on) | `no` unless set to exactly `yes`; **changing one needs a redeploy, not only a settings change** |
| `RIO_EMAIL_ENABLED` | no | no | `no` unless exactly `yes`. Confirmation e-mails are sent only with this AND the three settings below; until then the intention is only recorded in the outbox |
| `EMAIL_PROVIDER` | no | no | `resend` (the only provider implemented; choose the provider with the client) |
| `EMAIL_API_KEY` | **yes** | no | the provider's key with sending permission only; read in one file only (`lib/email/config.ts`) |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | no | no | a sender on a domain verified with the provider (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), for example `Rio Hospital <noreply@your-domain>` |
| `EMAIL_REPLY_TO` | no | no | optional |
| `CRON_SECRET` | **yes** | no | at least 32 random characters; the scheduler sends it as `Authorization: Bearer ...` to `/api/email-sweep`, which retries failed e-mails (404 for everyone else) |
| `RIO_STAFF_INVITES_ENABLED` | no | no | `no` unless exactly `yes`. Judge invitations from `/admin/judges`. While off, the form is disabled with a visible warning and no Supabase Auth call is made. Turn it on only after Supabase Authentication has working custom SMTP, the invitation template is pasted in and a test invitation was received. Also needs `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (server-only) |
| `RIO_STAFF_PROVISIONING_ENABLED` | no | no | **Apply migration 00900 first (section 6, step 3).** `no` unless exactly `yes`; a separate switch that never reads the invitations one. Lets an administrator create a judge account directly at `/admin/judges` (server-generated password shown once, nothing e-mailed, the judge must choose their own at first sign-in) and reset a judge's password. While off the form is disabled and no Supabase Auth call is made. Needs `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`; changing it needs a redeploy. Session safety: see PROJECT_BRIEF section 39.3 (also set the JWT expiry to 1 hour or less) |

Never set in Vercel: `RIO_DIST_DIR`, `RIO_DEV_PROJECT_REF`, `RIO_CONFIRM_PUSH`, `RIO_LIVE_*`, `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`, `SUPABASE_DEV_POOLER_URL`
(tooling and tests only). Preview deployments must have no production secrets (point them at DEV or give them none). Check R2 settings without printing
them: `npm run r2:check`.

### Backend database variables (hosting platform's runtime variables only; placeholders shown)

Production reads these from the platform's environment settings and never from a file. The server and the `db:*` tools refuse to run in production if `backend/.env.local` exists.

```
NODE_ENV=production
APP_ENV=production                      # must equal NODE_ENV
DB_DIALECT=mysql
DB_ENGINE=mariadb                       # explicit; production requires explicit MariaDB acceptance
DB_ALLOWED_HOST=<private host of the hosted MySQL 8>
DB_ALLOWED_DATABASE=<approved production database name>
DATABASE_URL=mysql://<user>:<password>@<same host as DB_ALLOWED_HOST>:3306/<same name as DB_ALLOWED_DATABASE>
DB_ACCEPT_MARIADB_IN_PRODUCTION=<same name as DB_ALLOWED_DATABASE>
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://<admin site>
PUBLIC_ORIGINS=https://<public site>
```

Rules enforced at start-up (tested in `backend/src/environment.test.ts`): `APP_ENV` must equal `NODE_ENV`; a loopback host, `sqlite` and a `*_test` database are refused in production; `DB_ALLOWED_DATABASE` must equal the database in `DATABASE_URL`; the connected server must match `DB_ENGINE` and `SELECT DATABASE()` must return the approved name. MariaDB in production is accepted only when `DB_ACCEPT_MARIADB_IN_PRODUCTION` names that same approved database. There is no fallback between environments: a missing value is an error. The build (`npm run build`) needs none of these variables, and the server never migrates on start. Explicit production database commands read `backend/.env` when invoked and validate `DB_ALLOWED_DATABASE` against the live connection.

## 3. Production resources needed

| Resource | Needed | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Supabase production project | create | separate from DEV; backups and point-in-time recovery on; region chosen with the client (data residency); only schema `public` exposed to the Data API |
| Supabase Auth | configure | email provider on, other providers off; OTP length and expiry fixed; site URL = production domain; project rate limits on; **custom SMTP** (see below) |
| Email delivery | create | Two separate uses of e-mail: (1) Supabase Auth sign-in codes, which need custom SMTP (the built-in sender allows only a handful per hour: not usable for launch) and the template `supabase/templates/otp-code.html`; (2) the app's confirmation e-mail through the provider API above. A domain with SPF, DKIM and DMARC serves both; the same provider can do both |
| Scheduler | create | a Vercel Cron (or any scheduler) calling `GET /api/email-sweep` with the bearer secret every 5 to 10 minutes once e-mail is enabled; add the cron entry to `vercel.json` at that time (not present now) |
| Supabase Auth: staff invitations | configure | Authentication > Email Templates > Invite user: paste `supabase/templates/invite-judge.html` (the link opens `/staff/set-password` with a one-time token, so the judge chooses a password; no password is ever e-mailed). Authentication > URL Configuration > Site URL: the website address. Custom SMTP must be working (the built-in sender allows only a few e-mails per hour). Password rules (length, strength) are set in Authentication > Providers > Email |
| Cloudflare R2 production bucket | create | **private**: no custom domain, `r2.dev` off. Token scoped to this bucket only. CORS: `PUT` from the production origin only (no wildcard), header `Content-Type`, expose `ETag`. Lifecycle: delete `pending/` objects after 1 day. No other public access |
| Vercel project | create | paid plan (the free plan is not for commercial use); region near Supabase; deployment protection on previews; function duration long enough for final submission (it reads up to 14 small ranges from R2) |
| Domain and HTTPS | client to supply | Vercel issues the certificate; the app already sends HSTS and `upgrade-insecure-requests` |
| Monitoring | create | the app **logs nothing by design** (no personal data in logs). Needs: Vercel runtime-error alerts and a log drain, Supabase log and advisor review, an uptime check on `/`, `/signin` and `/results`, a weekly audit-log review |
| Staff | client to name | administrators and judges (emails), judge confidentiality agreement |

**Video retention and deletion (missing, required before real children's data):** the cleanup script (`npm run uploads:cleanup`) deletes only replaced,
rejected and abandoned uploads; it never touches an attached video. A **withdrawn or taken-down entry leaves its video in R2**, and there is no deletion
tool. Needed: the client's retention period (for example delete all videos N days after the announcement), a written takedown and parent-erasure
procedure, and a small reviewed script or runbook that deletes the exact `videos/<id>` of a withdrawn entry and marks the upload deleted.

## 4. Client approvals and decisions required (none has been given; none is assumed)

| # | Decision | Effect while open |
|---|---|---|
| D5 | Consent wording approved by legal advisers, and a privacy notice and terms page (none exists in the app) | The only wording is `v0-provisional`; the screen says it is provisional. **Nothing in the code stops an administrator opening registration with it.** Approved text goes in as a NEW version (for example `v1`) in `lib/registration/consent.ts`, then a redeploy, then the administrator sets that version |
| D8 | Judging rubric, weights, judges per entry, tie rule | One 0 to 100 mark; ties are only flagged and the administrator decides. No rule has been invented |
| D9 | Registration window, upload deadline, judging period, publication time | Registration stays closed until set |
| D13 | Native-speaker review of all Tamil text | Tamil is provisional everywhere; staff screens are English with Tamil headings |
| D1 | Approved logo and assets | text placeholder in the header |
| New | Whether a child's first name may be published when the parent did **not** give the optional permission | The winners page shows the typed display name to everyone. The administrator screen now shows the permission (Yes or No) and warns; it does not block |
| New | Domain name, data region, video retention period, who the administrators and judges are, who approves publication | needed to configure production |

## 5. Critical risks and blockers

Blocker = do not launch until resolved or explicitly accepted in writing by the owner.

| # | Item | Class |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | **Rate limiting is in memory per server instance.** On Vercel each instance counts separately, so the limits on sign-in, registration, upload, submission, playback and scoring do not hold under real traffic or abuse. Supabase's own Auth limits remain. Fix before public launch: Vercel firewall rate-limit rules on `/signin`, `/events/*/register` and the action endpoints, and/or a shared store (database table or Redis) behind `lib/auth/rate-limit.ts` | **Blocker** |
| B2 | D5 and D8 undecided (section 4); no privacy notice | **Blocker** |
| B3 | No production project, migrations, bucket, SMTP, domain or deployment. The guarded migration tooling refuses production by design, so a reviewed production procedure (section 6, step 3) must be agreed | **Blocker** |
| B4 | **No real phone videos tested.** Only Chrome-made MP4 and WebM exist as fixtures. Not tested: iPhone MOV (usually HEVC), Android camera MP4, MOV with the index at the end, a 90 s / 100 MB file on a mobile network (single upload, no resume). A judge on a desktop browser without HEVC support may be unable to play an iPhone video | **Blocker** (run on real devices) |
| B5 | Header-level inspection only. It checks the container, a video track and the declared duration; it does **not** prove the frames decode, that a header is honest, or the length of a browser-recorded WebM (no duration) | Accepted limitation, to be stated to the client |
| B6 | Production email delivery not configured or tested | **Blocker** |
| B7 | No video deletion or takedown tool; retention undecided | Should-fix before real data |
| B8 | No server-side error logging or alerting | Should-fix |
| B9 | Publication and staff accounts by SQL only | Accepted with the runbook below |
| B10 | The accessibility and keyboard checklist (axe, keyboard-only pass, reduced motion) has been run for the browser components, not for the staff and results pages as pages; contrast and 360 px were measured for the results page | Should-fix |
| B11 | Eight days remain to the announcement: registration, uploads, judging and approval all have to fit | Schedule risk |
| B12 | Switches are fixed at build time: enabling one needs a redeploy | Operational note |
| B13 | Confirmation e-mail has never been sent for real: provider not chosen, domain not verified, migration 00800 not applied, no scheduler. Everything is tested with mocks only. The app promises an e-mail nowhere while it is off | **Blocker for the confirmation e-mail only** (leave `RIO_EMAIL_ENABLED=no` and the launch can proceed without it) |
| B14 | The logo used everywhere is the supplied `rio logo v2.png` (giraffe, in the approved mock-ups 03 to 06). Mock-up 01 and 02 show a different lotus logo that was not supplied, and no hero photograph or illustrations were supplied: the owner must provide approved files if wanted | Should-fix |
| B15 | Judge invitations have never been sent for real: no hosted account was created, SMTP and the invitation template are not configured or tested, and `RIO_STAFF_INVITES_ENABLED` is `no`. Existing judges are unaffected | **Blocker for inviting judges from the screen only** (the two provisioned DEV accounts keep working) |

## 6. Deployment steps (each needs the owner's explicit approval; do not run any of them without it)

1. Resolve the blockers B1 to B3 and B6 or accept them in writing. Record the approvals in `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`.
2. Create the production Supabase project; enable backups; set Auth (section 3); configure SMTP and DNS; send yourself a test email.
3. Apply migrations `20261105000100` to `20261105000700`, in order, to **production only after** the same files are confirmed unchanged by their hashes
   (00100 `fe3e2851f8343d46`, 00200 `224b5d0ce4801714`, 00300 `b36e4314f56dd4f9`, 00400 `8c995be9d66de368`, 00500 `321659c194f2f25d`,
   00600 `539ae80ea433ea86`, 00700 `dbedd1f8efabaf09`, each a prefix of its SHA-256). Use a reviewed, approved procedure (the guarded tool is DEV-only).
   Migration `20261105000800` (the confirmation e-mail outbox, hash prefix `1d52fdcc7890f69a`) is **applied to the DEV project only (2026-11-07, guarded push, with 00900); not applied to production**: apply it after 00700 only
   when the owner approves enabling the confirmation e-mail. Until then the app records nothing, and a submission is never affected.
   Migration `20261105000900` (judge first-login password gate in the database and the labelled password-reset audit event, hash prefix `891609dc54f9b03b`, rollback `supabase/rollback/20261105000900_down.sql`) is **applied to the DEV project only (2026-11-07, guarded push, verified: catalog identical to a local 00100 to 00900 build); not applied to production**: apply it after 00700 (00800 is independent) **before** `RIO_STAFF_PROVISIONING_ENABLED=yes`, with the owner's approval; without it the first-login rule is enforced by the application only and a password reset has no labelled audit event.
   Verify as was done on DEV: history, six events, registration closed (all settings null), function owners and EXECUTE rights, RLS on every table.
4. Create the production R2 bucket, token, CORS and lifecycle rule (section 3). Run `npm run r2:check` with the production values.
5. Create staff. Staff sign in at `/staff/login` with an email and a password; accounts are created only by a project owner, never by the app.
   - **DEV (script):** `RIO_LIVE_CONFIRM=<dev ref> RIO_CONFIRM_PROVISION=<dev ref> npm run staff:provision -- --role admin --email <email>` or
     `... --role judge --email <email> --name "<display name>"`. It asks for the password twice at a hidden prompt (or reads `RIO_STAFF_PASSWORD` set for
     that one command), passes it only to Supabase Auth, prints nothing secret, refuses the production project, and is safe to repeat. `--reset-password`
     sets a new password for an existing account. A password must be 12 to 128 characters, not contain the email name, not be a common password.
   - **Production (by hand, no script):** Supabase dashboard, Authentication, Users, "Add user": the email, a password typed there, "Auto confirm user" on. Then in
     the SQL editor (no password anywhere in SQL):
     `insert into public.user_roles (user_id, role) select id, 'admin' from auth.users where email = '<email>';`
     and for a judge `... 'judge' ...` followed by
     `insert into public.judge_profiles (user_id, display_name) select id, '<name>' from auth.users where email = '<email>';`
   - **Judges should be created with Rio Admin (Add judge), not by hand.** An account made in the dashboard carries no first-login mark (`app_metadata.must_change_password`), so the database gate
     of migration 00900 does not apply to it and the person keeps whatever password was typed. Rio Admin sets the mark at creation, confirms it from the saved account, and the judge area stays closed until the
     judge has chosen their own password. Use the dashboard route for administrators only, or for a judge only with the owner's explicit acceptance of that difference.
   - A person with no role, a parent, and a judge whose profile is `active = false` are refused at `/staff/login` even with a correct password.
     Deactivate a judge with `update public.judge_profiles set active = false where user_id = (select id from auth.users where email = '<email>');`
   - Staff can also still sign in with an e-mailed code at `/signin` (same account, same role check); that cannot be switched off without changing the parent flow.
   - Passwords are handled by Supabase Auth only. Choose a strong password per person, share it by a channel the hospital trusts, and have each person keep it private.
     Set the Supabase password rules (minimum length, leaked-password protection if the plan allows) on the production project.
6. Create the Vercel project, domain and Production environment variables (section 2) with **all three switches `no`** and the production R2 account id present.
   Deploy.
7. Run the post-deployment verification (section 7) with the switches still off.
8. Rehearse on a non-production pair (a second Supabase project and bucket) with real phone videos and an administrator and judge account (blocker B4).
9. Approved text and window: add the approved consent version, redeploy, then an administrator sets `current_consent_version` and the window in `event_settings`.
10. Enable features in order, each followed by a redeploy and a check: `RIO_UPLOADS_ENABLED=yes`, then `RIO_FINALIZE_ENABLED=yes`, then (when judging starts) `RIO_PLAYBACK_ENABLED=yes`.
11. Publication, only on the owner's instruction and not before 14 November 2026 IST: confirm winners in the administrator area, review the sharing-permission column,
    then a project owner runs `update public.event_settings set results_publish_at = '<approved time with +05:30>';`. The database refuses any earlier date. To withdraw
    a result, delete the winner in the administrator area (it disappears from `/results` at once).

## 7. Post-deployment verification (read-only unless stated)

- `/` loads over HTTPS; `/results` answers "The winners announcement date will be confirmed later" (until the client approves a date in `lib/events.ts`) and its response has `Cache-Control: no-store`.
- Response headers: HSTS, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, and a Content-Security-Policy that does **not** name the bucket host while uploads and playback are off.
- Registration page shows "closed" before the window; a direct database insert as a parent is refused (`submissions_closed`).
- `/admin` and `/judge` send a signed-out visitor to `/staff/login`; a signed-in parent gets 404; `/staff/login` shows the form, is not indexed, and offers no registration; a wrong password gives the generic message (after the staff account exists).
- Sign-in email arrives from the production sender with a code of the configured length (staff address only).
- R2: the bucket has no public URL; an unsigned request for any object returns 403; `r2.dev` is off; CORS names only the production origin.
- Catalog: the four judging/finalization functions are SECURITY DEFINER with an empty search path and no EXECUTE for PUBLIC, anon or authenticated (except `assign_judge_to_event` for authenticated); the old `finalize_submission` is absent; function body fingerprints equal the repository's (`npm run db:dev:inspect judging_function_acls` shape).
- Supabase advisors show no security errors; every public table has RLS.
- After switches are on, with approval: one rehearsal (the journey test pattern) against the non-production pair, never against live children's data.

## 8. Go / no-go checklist

All must be "Met" for GO. Today's status is the right-hand column.

| # | Condition | Status |

| 2 | Rubric and tie rule decided, or the owner accepts the placeholder (D8) | **Not met** |
| 3 | Dates and window decided (D9); publication time approved | **Not met** |
| 4 | Tamil copy reviewed, or the owner accepts it as provisional (D13) | **Not met** |
| 5 | Production Supabase, R2, Vercel, domain and SMTP created and configured | **Not met** |
| 6 | Migrations 00100 to 00700 applied to production and verified | **Not met** (DEV: Met) |
| 7 | Rate limiting suitable for public use (B1) | **Not met** |
| 8 | Uploads verified on real phone formats and a mobile network (B4) | **Not met** |
| 9 | Email OTP delivery verified end to end on the production sender (B6) | **Not met** |

| 17 | All three switches `no` until their step in section 6 | Met |
| 18 | Confirmation e-mail: provider chosen, domain verified, 00800 applied, a real test e-mail received, scheduler set; or the owner accepts launching without it | **Not met** (e-mail stays `no`) |
| 19 | The owner approves the new look of the public pages (pink and indigo palette, logo file) | **Not met** |
